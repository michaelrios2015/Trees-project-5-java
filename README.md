An example of a bunch of different tree structures using java, it was not perfect but hopefully shows a basic understanding 

You are to design a Java program to perform the following tasks:
	
*  read a sequence of integers, 60, 20, 100, 35, 15, 200, 75, 
*  150, 6, 17, and 40, and construct a binary search tree,
   called T1.
* use the inorder procedure to print the nodes
* count the number of leaf nodes of T1.
* swap the nodes of T1 to construct a new tree, called T2.
* use the postorder function to print the nodes of T2.
* use the function compare to see if T1 is identical to T2.
* read another sequence of integers, 60, 100, 20, 15, 35, 75, 
	  200, 6, 17,
	  40, 150, and construct another tree, called T3.
* use the function Compare to see if T1 is identical to T3.
* Delete the node containing 15 from the tree T3
* Use the inorder  to display the nodes after deletion
* Display the 5th node of the tree T3 using INORDER


You may need to design the following functions:

1. Function Build: read a sequence of integers and construct a binary search tree.

2. Function Inorder: based on the BST tree built, conduct the "INORDER" traversal and print the value of each node when visited.

3. Function Postorder: based on the BST tree built, conduct the "POSTORDER" traversal and print the value of each node when visited.

4. Function Count: write a function that counts the number of leaf nodes in the tree and return the count. Do not use unnecessary local variables and parameters.

5. Function Swap: swap the left and right children(subtree) recursively of every node of the given tree. 

6. Function Compare: return TRUE if the two given trees are identical.
7.  Using appropriate messages to explain each output described above.
